# a comment! this is so I can read my program later and I know what the tits is going on. 
# Obvi - commenting is important. Once you come out of a programming haze it's useful to know what's going on. 

print "This is a string" # this is a comment

# comments are also useful when you have a line of code that you don't want to run 
# sometimes you have to systematically debug line by line - comments help with that

# print "This string won't run."

print "But this one will!"
